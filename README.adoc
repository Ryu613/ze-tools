== allocator

This Arena framework is a modern, policy-based memory allocator designed for high performance, flexibility, and maintainability. It decouples memory strategies using a highly composable architecture, enabling a wide variety of allocation schemes while maintaining maximum control over behavior.

The Arena class template accepts four policy types:

* ResourcePolicy: Manages the raw memory buffer.

* AllocatorPolicy: Implements the allocation algorithm on top of the resource.

* LockingPolicy: Defines thread-safety behavior.

* TrackingPolicy: Handles allocation tracking and logging.

This design supports configurations such as:

* Linear or heap-based memory pooling

* Stateless or stateful allocators

* Lock-free or thread-safe allocations

* Silent or verbose logging of allocations

=== usage

[source, c++]
----
	using HeapAllocator = ze::Arena<
		ze::ResourcePolicy::NullResource,
		ze::AllocatorPolicy::RawHeapAllocator,
		ze::LockingPolicy::NoLock,
		ze::TrackingPolicy::Untracked
	>;

    MyArena arena("FastPool", 1024 * 1024); // 1MB pool
    void* p = arena.alloc(64, 16);

== collection

=== sparse_set

`sparse_set` is a high-performance sparse set designed for performance-sensitive scenarios, particularly useful in game engines, real-time graphics systems, ECS (Entity Component Systems), and other environments where memory access patterns and low-latency are critical.

It is based on a "dense + sparse" dual-mapping structure that offers extremely fast insert, query, and delete operations (theoretically constant time). Furthermore, it provides cache-friendly sequential iteration, greatly outperforming traditional STL containers like `std::unordered_set` in terms of traversal and locality.

=== Features

* üöÄ **O(1) Complexity**: Insert, delete, and lookup operations all have constant time complexity.
* üß† **High Locality**: `dense_` array is stored contiguously, supporting fast iteration and SIMD optimizations.
* üî¨ **Customizable Types**: Supports a generic `T` type (default `uint32_t`), with indices stored in `sparse_[T]`.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Allocator Support**: Full support for `std::pmr` polymorphic memory resources, making it easy to integrate with memory pools.
* üßπ **No Overhead**: Lightweight structure, zero additional vtables, no hidden heap allocations.
* üí° **Engineering Friendly**: Header-only implementation, easy to integrate; provides STL-style interfaces, iterators, `find`, `clear`, and more standard methods.

=== Performance Comparison

Based on a benchmark with 1 million random entries, the following performance results were observed (Release / MSVC):

C++20, x64, windows10, VS2022, cmake release mode:
[source]
----
sparse_set run 1: 16 ms
pmr::sparse_set run 1: 5 ms // unsynchronized_pool_resource
unordered_set run 1: 108 ms
----

On average, `sparse_set` provides **6-8x faster** insert, lookup, and delete performance compared to `std::unordered_set`.

and pmr_sparse_set(with unsynchronized_pool_resource) even better

see Collection/test/test_sparse_set.cpp

=== usage

[source,cpp]
----
#include "sparse_set.hpp"

sparse_set<uint32_t> s;
s.insert(42);
if (s.contains(42)) {
    s.erase(42);
}
----

=== pmr support

If you need custom allocators (e.g., using thread-local memory pools, arenas, monotonic allocation, etc.), you can use the `pmr_sparse_set` version:

[source,cpp]
----
std::array<std::byte, 1024 * 1024> buffer;
std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource pool(buffer.data(), buffer.size());

pmr::sparse_set<uint32_t> s(64, &pool);
s.insert(1);
----

== ECS

This is a basic implementation of an Entity Component System (ECS) designed for high-performance and flexible data-driven game development. The system utilizes archetypes, chunks, and components, ensuring an efficient way of managing entities and their associated data.

=== Features
- Efficient memory management with custom allocators and pooling
- Support for both trivial and non-trivial component types
- Optimized for cache locality and quick iteration
- Component signature system for fast type-based filtering
- Simple API to create, remove, and update entities

== Architecture Overview
The ECS is designed around the following key concepts:

* **Entity**: An identifier for a game object or entity.
* **Component**: A data structure representing a single aspect of an entity.
* **Archetype**: A grouping of entities that share the same set of components.
* **Chunk**: A contiguous block of memory used to store entities' components, improving cache locality and access speed.

=== usage

[source, C++]
----
int main() {
    ecs::init();
    ecs::Entity e = ecs::make_entity<Position, Attr>(
        Position{ 50,24,12 },
        Attr{ 120, 100 }
    );
    // add Position & Attr component data to e
    ecs::add_component<Position, Attr>(e, Position{ 20,10,20 }, Attr{ 20, 105 });
    // add Position component data to e
    ecs::add_component<Position>(e, Position{ 20, 10, 20 });
    // add new component Extra to e
    ecs::add_component<Extra>(e, Extra{});
    // add new component Another and add these data to component
    ecs::add_component<Position, Another>(e, Position{ 20,40,20 }, Another{ 1.135656888 });
    // true
    ecs::has_components<Attr>(e);
    // remove Another component from e
    ecs::remove_components<Another>(e);
    // destroy entity e
    ecs::destroy_entity(e);
    // register new system and enable it
    // can add stage & priority in the future
    ecs::register_system<MoveSystem>();
    // trigger specific system's OnUpdate();
    ecs::system_update<MoveSystem>();
    // trigger registered systems' OnUpdate() in order
    ecs::system_update_all();
    // disable system not unregister
    ecs::disable_system<MoveSystem>();
    // re-enable system
    ecs::enable_system<MoveSystem>();
    // unregister system
    //ecs::unregister_system<MoveSystem>();
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
